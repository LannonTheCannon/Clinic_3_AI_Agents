# Challenge Database

This contains the lead score segmentation and challenge data.

```
challenges/data/database-sql-transactions/leads_scored_segmentation.db
```

The `generate_segmentation.py` script generates the lead score segmentation data.

The "leads_scored" table has been updated with a column called "segment".
